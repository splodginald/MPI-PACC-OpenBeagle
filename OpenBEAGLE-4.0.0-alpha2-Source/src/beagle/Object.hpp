 *  \brief Object, smart pointers, and casting functions, part of the Object Oriented Foundations.
 *
 *  In Open BEAGLE, most classes are derived from an abstract class called Beagle::Object. An
 *  Open BEAGLE object comprises some general methods that are characteristic of a complete C++ 
 *  object. The usual C++ objects comparison operators are defined, receiving arguments of the  
 *  Beagle::Object type and calling the appropriate comparison method (Beagle::Object::isEqual or 
 *  Beagle::Object::isLess). The methods Beagle::Object::read and Beagle::Object::write are used to 
 *  extract/insert an object into devices, in XML.
 *
 *  A Beagle::Object also implements a reference counter that remembers the number of references 
 *  that point to it. The C++ language defines two ways of allocating an object instance. First, the
 *  instance can be allocated on the stack, it will then be destructed at the end of the scope. 
 *  Second, the instance can be allocated on the heap with a call to the \c new operator, which 
 *  means that it is necessary to apply a symmetrical \c delete at the end of the instance 
 *  lifetime. With Open BEAGLE, there is a variation on the second way to allocate objects: an Open 
 *  BEAGLE object can be allocated on the heap and affected to Open BEAGLE smart pointers that 
 *  interact with the object reference counter. The destruction of the object is then the 
 *  responsibility of the smart pointers.
 *
 *  An Open BEAGLE smart pointer acts like a standard C++ pointer that manage the memory used by the 
 *  pointed objects. It is implemented it in class Beagle::Pointer, which is tightly linked to the 
 *  reference counter of class Beagle::Object. The implementation of the Beagle::Pointer class 
 *  guarantees that the pointed object exists since there is a smart pointer that refer to it. It also
 *  guarantees that the object will be destroyed when its last reference will vanish. This emulates 
 *  the appreciated garbage collection mechanism of some programming languages. In fact, the Open 
 *  BEAGLE smart pointers are coherent with the creation and the garbage collecting of objects of the 
 *  \e Java language. The two things that the user should remember is to allocate objects on the heap
 *  (with a \c new) and never interfere with object destruction after assigning them to smart 
 *  pointers. Once an object is referred by smart pointer, the memory management responsibility is 
 *  held by the smart pointer.
 *
 *  Exceptionally, the Beagle::Pointer class and its subclasses do not inherit from superclass  
 *  Beagle::Object. Like a C++ pointer, an Open BEAGLE pointer can be assigned to a null pointer. The 
 *  class also provides the two usual dereferencing operators, \c operator* and \c operator->, 
 *  which return a reference to the pointed object. There is also two comparison operators
 *  (\c operator== and \c operator!=) between two Beagle::Pointer, between a Beagle::Pointer and an 
 *  Beagle::Object* and the null pointer testing operator (\c operator!).
 *
 *  Since any instance are concrete objects and smart pointers gives references to the abstract
 *  Beagle::Object type, each access to methods or attributes that are not declared in the object 
 *  interface needs a cast of the reference given by the smart pointer to the desired derived type. 
 *  This could lead to inelegant code, or even type inconsistencies if old C-style casts were used. To
 *  avoid these problems, there is a templated class, Beagle::PointerT, that defines the pointer
 *  unreferencing operators to the desired type.
 *  \code
 *  template <class T, class BaseType>
 *  class PointerT : public BaseType {
 *  public:
 *    inline T& operator*();
 *    inline T* operator->();
 *  };
 *  \endcode
 *  The Beagle::PointerT template also emulates the mechanism of automatic pointer type binding for 
 *  inheritance-related classes. This allows a compile-time binding of T-type smart pointers 
 *  that inherit from the \c BaseType, when a \c BaseType object is needed. For example, suppose a
 *  method taking an argument of the type \c Base::Handle, which is a smart pointer to an 
 *  object instance of the class \c Base. With the automatic type binding of smart pointer, the 
 *  method can get as argument a smart pointer to the type \c Derived::Handle, supposing that the 
 *  class \c Derived inherits from the class \c Base. This can be done without any explicit cast 
 *  of the smart pointers. Beagle::PointerT has two templated parameters: the type of object handled, 
 *  the T-type, and the parent type of the smart pointer, the \c BaseType. The \c BaseType is useful 
 *  for the automatic type binding emulation by inheritance.
 *
 *  For each class of Open BEAGLE, the nested type \c Handle is declared. This is the type of 
 *  handle to the class, that is, a smart pointer that gives exact reference type. Usually, this type 
 *  is simply declared as a synonym of a parametrized Beagle::PointerT.
 *  \code
 *  class AnyClass : public SuperClass {
 *  public:
 *    typedef PointerT<AnyClass,SuperClass::Handle> Handle;
 *    ...
 *  };
 *  \endcode
 *  Doing so, a smart pointer can be used to return reference to the right type, the type \c 
 *  AnyClass, simply by working with the right handle type, \c AnyClass::Handle. It is a good 
 *  practice to define the nested \c Handle type for every class that inherits directly or 
 *  indirectly from an Beagle::Object.
 *
 *  With the ANSI/ISO C++ standard, it is highly recommended to use the new style cast operators 
 *  instead of the old C-style one. This new style cast operators, such the operators \c static_cast 
 *  and \c const_cast, are more specialized cast operations. The use of different cast operators
 *  prevent some unwanted casting operations that could lead to nasty hidden bugs. In the Beagle
 *  namespace, three new cast operator is defined, Beagle::castObjectT(Beagle::Object*),
 *  Beagle::castObjectT(Beagle::Object&), and Beagle::castHandleT(Beagle::Object::Handle). These
 *  operators must be use to cast any Open BEAGLE object type into another object type. The usage of  
 *  this casting operator is identical to the usage of new style cast operators.
